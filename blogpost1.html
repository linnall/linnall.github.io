                    Do you see that girl from afar? The one with the crooked smile and confident gait? 
                    Clearly, she’s happy in one way or another. Perhaps she enjoys being outdoors or 
                    she’s on her way to yoga class or just had a great lunch; happy, but she could be 
                    so much more. Look closer. If you got close enough, could you see that she could feel 
                    herself breaking down, bit by bit, piece by piece? 
                </p>
                
                <p class="bodyp">
                    From afar, every blemish, every scar, every impurity melded out of existence. 
                    Yes, she had visible flaws - she could be caught biting her nails amidst an 
                    exam or be surrounded by a messy study space of her own making- but the minor 
                    details, only she was aware of. Whereas others saw her as one shade of blue, 
                    she was aware of the speckles of cerulean, azure and turquoise that dotted her 
                    composition.
                </p>
    
                <p class="bodyp">
                    She was falling apart at the seams as her assortment of sadness threatened to 
                    break from its confines. However, blue was her favourite colour; it screamed 
                    of an endless expanse of sky with no beginning and certainly no end. Her desire 
                    to chase after her endless list of wonders and wishes bled out with the hues.
                </p>
    
                <p class="bodyp">
                    The question that haunted her was could she handle it? What if by letting 
                    the stream trickle free she’d dilute the richness of hope from her being? 
                    What if her monochromatic mess ripped havoc on her life? What if the world 
                    could not comprehend, let alone accept the blots that tarnished her smooth 
                    complexion. So, she kept it hidden deep within herself. She allowed every 
                    shade of blue to melt into one another; for now, she would stay a homogeneous 
                    mixture to the naked eye. 
                </p>
    
                <p class="bodyp">
                    Zoom out. She wasn’t ready to share her riveting thoughts, feelings and 
                    ideas just yet. They were still brewing, developing, solidifying. All while 
                    she was gathering the courage to one day relinquish the barrier and unleash 
                    her aspirations upon the canvas that was her world.
