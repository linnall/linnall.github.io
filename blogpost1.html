                Do you see that girl from afar? The one with the crooked smile and confident gait? 
                Clearly, she’s happy in one way or another. Perhaps she enjoys being outdoors or 
                she’s on her way to yoga class or just had a great lunch; happy, but she could be 
                so much more. Look closer. If you got close enough, could you see that she could feel 
                herself breaking down, bit by bit, piece by piece?
