                    I watch the snow fall and I think to myself 'this is beautiful', but there is one particular type of snowfall that is my favourite.
                </p>
                
                <p class="bodyp">
                    The soft and silent type; where the snowflakes catch on gusts of wind and they are brought down to the ground ever so gently.
                    Every flake beelines for the ground, but each one takes its time.
                    At night under the glow of a streetlamp you can see each individual flake on its way down.
                    Each flake is lit up in the spotlight just for a moment as it passes in and out of frame;
                    we each have our moments.
                </p>
    
                <p class="bodyp">
                    Isn't it facinating that such small pieces of matter can shine against a black night that encapsulates the night?
                    Perhaps the streetlamp that gives snow its spotlight are like certain people we meet;
                    they highlight us for a moment in time but don't end up following.
                    The streetlamp stays stagnant - frozen in that place in time. 
                </p>
